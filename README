This is an experiment. It's not official. It may all get merged back
into the proper trunk at http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/

That's where you want to be now. Go on, off you go, I don't mind.

Still here?

Ok, right now, the "docbook" projects at GitHub are being worked on
by Norman Walsh, ndw@nwalsh.com.

I'm experimenting with Git and with a fairly radical redesign of some
parts of the DocBook XSL stylesheets to better support dynamic styling
from environments like XML databases.

It's not clear if this is a good idea or not. It's not clear if doing
this at github is a good idea or not. Not much is clear.

But I wanted a place to do this and I wanted to try git and so here I
am.
